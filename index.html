                Hi! My name is Christopher, I specialize in
                Web development. Specifically frontend, i have worked with HTML,CSS
                and Native Javascript. On the backend, I have knowledge of MySQL
                combined with a use of NodeJS to Send and Receive
                all types of requests (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE).

              This is part of the Udemy Javascript course i took, i started to learn more and more logic
               and this was only a small exercise that consisted of calculating multiple classrooms'
              average and found the highest student's grade of all the classes. March 30th 2021

              So this project I made in April of 2021, during Covid days. While staying at home, I had been following
              the Javascript course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy, and this was a small project of that time
              with transitions and many hover effects.

              This project was a first try of creating a small database using localStorage in javascript.
               I made it in October of 2022 and added new CSS tricks for the
               navigation bar, aswell as new javascript properties like (add and remove objects from array after prompt and clearing storage)

              This project was once again in October of 2022, while i was trying to develop more
               of my Javascript Logic skills, other than only focusing on transitions and effects.

              This is still in the end of October 2022, where i was
              again trying to learn back some Javascript functionalities, because i hadn't programmed in some time.
              I learned the usage of API's and even included some basic Web APIs for Javascript
              (Clipboard,Web Audio, Drag and Drop, EyeDropper)

              Although it was not multiple pages, the difficulties with this website was that I had to be autonomous.
              To copy every single element, color fade, dropdown effect and div centering.

              This is my first real NodeJs CRUD application. You basically add a name that you can then edit and choose to delete.
              There is also an option to search through the names that are listed, hence
              the name : Name Finder.
